Prerequisites
The code works with Matlab R2011B, other versions may work as well. 
For the SVM implementation, the LIBSVM Matlab interface is needed. The code will only work if the LIBSVM functions are available, i.e. calling svmtrain runs the LIBSVM function and not the Matlab function. Apart from that, no external libraries are needed.

Running the code
To run the code for all questions, run runall.m. 
To run code for question i, run qi.m (for example q1.m for question 1). Questions 2 and 3 are combined in q2and3.m.

Functions used in the exam are usually implemented in separated functions and can also be used separately. They all have reasonable names and it should be possible to find the one you're looking for.
